# Gridle.CSS

We created Gridle.CSS for another side project we're currently working on,
booqmark.it . At first, with booqmark.it, we've used Bootstrap and it did a
great job, untill we started designing the user interface, we found that with
Bootstrap, we had to overwrite too much in order to achieve a "flat" design and
get rid of that 'bootstrap' look that many websites have these days.

Current flexbox grids out there are good, but they're not exactly what we need
either. So what better way to get what you want than to create your own? Plus,
learning flexbox was on our to-do list for far too long!
