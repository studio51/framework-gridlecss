# GridleCSS

I created GridleCSS for another side project I'm currently working on, booqmark.it .
At first, with booqmark.it, I've used Bootstrap and it did a great job, untill I
started designing the user interface, I found that with Bootstrap I had to
overwrite too much in order to achieve a "flat" design and get rid of that
'bootstrap' look that many websites have these days.

Current flexbox grids out there are good, but I've felt that they're not exactly
what I need either. So what better way to get what you want than to create your
own? Plus, learning flexbox was on my to-do list for too long!

## Features

At the moment, there are no components, but I do plan to write a few ( feel free to create your own and add them here ) .

* Buttons
* Tables
* Forms
* Alerts
* Pagination
